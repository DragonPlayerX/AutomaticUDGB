# AutomaticUDGB

This program is used to fetch all Unity Versions from Unity Archive and compares the result with [Unity-Runtime-Libraries](https://github.com/LavaGang/Unity-Runtime-Libraries).

All missing dependencies are displayed and can optionally be generated by the integrated [UDGB](https://github.com/LavaGang/UDGB).
